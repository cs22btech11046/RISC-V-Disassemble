IN MAIN:
1. File is read line by line in a text file using "fgets" and counted how many line in txt file.
2. Then Each line is stored in "hexarr[count]" as string of size 9 because last is null terminator
3. then every line is called in "hextobin" function and returns string of size 33 to a char variable "binary"
4. Take last 7 characters of "binary" using "strncpy" and store it in opcode variable
5. This is used for knowing it is of which type "I","R","B","S","J" or "U".
6. The "binary" variable is used as argument to funtions of "I","R","B","S","J" and "U".And the opcode decides to which function the "binary" variable should go as argument.
7. And print the instructions respectively to which the "binary goes".

hextobin : coverts hex to binary and returns it as string
decimal(input,n): converts binary to decimal and returns decimal value(Takes input and its size as arguments)

RType: Firstly define variables as:
					char f7[8];
					char rs2[6];
					char rs1[6];
					char f3[4];
					char rd[6];

1. extract respective binary string using "strncpy"
2. First compare f7 and after again compare with f3
3. decimal function will convert rs2[6] and rs1[6] and rd[6] to their respective decimal values
4. And print respective instructions.

Remaining Functions slight changed mad in R function.
I used strcat for adding two function and strcpy to copy the string in a respective variable.
